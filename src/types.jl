### *Customized Dictionaries*

#=
*Remarks* :

The values in the following dictionaries are actually arrays, which
usually contain four elements:
* Element[1] -> Actually value.
* Element[2] -> If it is 1, this key-value pair is mandatory.
                If it is 0, this key-value pair is optional.
* Element[3] -> Numerical type (A julia Symbol).
* Element[4] -> Brief explanations.

The following dictionaries are used as global variables.

    ACFlow

ACFlow is a modern software toolkit for solving the many-body analytic
continuation problem. It is usually used to convert the single-particle
or two-particle correlators from imaginary axis to real axis. Now this
toolkit is under heavy development. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

Nowadays the ACFlow toolkit supports the following algorithms:

* Maximum Entropy Method (`MaxEnt` solver, `recommended`)
* Barycentric Rational Function Method (`BarRat` solver, `experimental`)
* Nevanlinna Analytical Continuation (`NevanAC` solver, `experimental`)
* Stochastic Analytic Continuation (`StochAC` and `StochSK` solvers)
* Stochastic Optimization Method (`StochOM` solver)
* Stochastic Pole eXpansion (`StochPX` solver, `recommended`)

More algorithms will be implemented in the future.

Note that ACFlow toolkit has been designed to be integrated into the
`Zen` package. Actually, it is also compatible with the `iQIST` toolkit.
In the other words, the end user can use it to analytically continue the
imaginary time (or Matsubara frequency) data generated by the various
quantum impurity solvers in the `iQIST` toolkit. Of course, it is quite
easy to implement some kinds of interfaces for the other quantum impurity
solvers.

For more details about how to obtain, install and use the ACFlow toolkit,
please visit the following website:

* `https://huangli712.github.io/projects/acflow/index.html`

Any suggestions, comments, and feedbacks are welcome. Enjoy it!

The `Zygote` package is used to to calculate gradient via an automatic
differentiation approach. The `NevanAC` solver depends on it to perform
the Hardy basis function optimization. However, once you have trouble in
installing `Zygote`, we also provide an built-in gradient function,
which implements a finite difference approach (it is quite slow). Please
see the comments in `nac.jl` about how to activate the built-in gradient
function.

# Stochastic Analytical Continuation 1

In principle, for given Green's function $G$, there exists infinitely many spectral densities $A(\omega)$ that can be used to reproduce $G$ via Eq.~(\ref{eq:kernel_t}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:kernel_w}). The maximum entropy method tries to pick up the most likely spectral function which maximizes $P[A|\bar{G}]$ (It actually maximizes $Q$)~\cite{PhysRevB.44.6011,JARRELL1996133}. Here, we would like to introduce an alternative approach, namely the stochastic analytical continuation~\cite{PhysRevB.57.10287,PhysRevE.81.056701,beach,PhysRevX.7.041072,PhysRevE.94.063308,PhysRevLett.118.147207,PhysRevLett.63.1523,Shao:2022yez}. It is argued that the weights for all the possible spectral densities are the same if they can give rise to the same $\chi^2$. At first, a sequence of spectral densities will be generated by stochastic method. Then an unbiased thermal average of all possible spectra, Boltzmann weighted according to goodness-of-fit function $\chi^{2}$, produces an average spectrum. Thus sometimes the method was named as average spectrum method or stochastic sampling method in the references~\cite{PhysRevB.101.085111,PhysRevB.102.035114,PhysRevB.76.035115,PhysRevB.78.174429}. There are several variants for the stochastic analytical continuation. Next we will introduce two representative algorithms as proposed by A. W. Sandvik~\cite{PhysRevB.57.10287} and K. S. D. Beach~\cite{beach}, respectively.

## Sandvik's algorithm

Here, the $\delta$ functions reside at unrestricted frequencies $\{\omega_i\}$, but their amplitudes $\{\gamma_i\}$ are equal and fixed. Note that different parameterizations are also possible~\cite{Shao:2022yez}. \label{fig:san}}
\end{figure}

It was early on realized that a different way to achieve a smooth spectrum is to average over many solutions with reasonable $\chi^2$ values~\cite{PhysRevLett.63.1523}. Several years later, A. W. Sandvik introduced the stochastic analytical continuation in a slightly different form~\cite{PhysRevB.57.10287}. He suggested that the spectral function $A(\omega)$ can be parameterized using $N$ $\delta$ functions (Please see Fig.~\ref{fig:san} for schematic diagram):
```math
\begin{equation}
A(\omega) = \sum^{N}_{i = 1} \gamma_i \delta(\omega - \omega_i),
\end{equation}
```
where $\gamma_i$ and $\omega_i$ denote the amplitude and position of the $i$-th $\delta$ function, respectively. Next, the Metropolis important sampling algorithm is employed to sample the configuration space $\mathcal{C} = \{\omega_i, \gamma_i\}$. In practice, there are two elementary Monte Carlo updates. One is to change the amplitudes of a pair of $\delta$ functions under the constraint $\sum_i \gamma_i = 1$. Another one is to shift position of a randomly chosen $\delta$ function. Of course, block or global updates can be implemented to improve ergodicity and sampling efficiency~\cite{PhysRevB.101.085111,PhysRevB.102.035114}. 

The transition probability of Monte Carlo updates reads:
```math
\begin{equation}
p(\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}') = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta\chi^2}{2\Theta}\right),
\end{equation}
```
where the goodness-of-fit function $\chi^2$ can be evaluated by Eq.~(\ref{eq:chi2}), $\Theta$ is a regulation parameter which is similar to the $\alpha$ parameter appeared in the maximum entropy method. Well, the remaining problem is how to fix $\Theta$. Sandvik suggested to measure the following entropic term for some $\Theta$:
```math
\begin{equation}
S(\Theta) = - \sum^{N}_{i = 1} \gamma_i \log(\gamma_i) K(0,\omega_i),
\end{equation}
```
where $K$ is the kernel function as defined above. Then make a plot of $S$ with respect to $\log(\Theta^{-1})$. Overall, when $\Theta$ is large, $S$ exhibits large fluctuations. When $\Theta$ is small, $S$ will approach its global minimum steadily. A sharp drop in $S$ before the approach to a constant value has been observed, and there is a local maximum at some $\Theta = \hat{\Theta}$ preceding the drop. Thus, Sandvik postulated that $\hat{\Theta}$ was the optimum value at which to accumulate and average the spectral function. Sylju\aa{}sen *et al.* suggested that let $\Theta = 1$. Fuchs \emph{et al.} tried to fix $\Theta$ by using Bayesian inference. Such that their approach was named as stochastic analytical inference. Very recently, Shao and Sandvik *et al.* proposed a smart method to determine the optimal value of $\Theta$. $\Theta$ is adjusted so that
```math
\begin{equation}
\langle \chi^2(\Theta) \rangle \approx \chi^{2}_{\text{min}} + c \sqrt{2\chi^2_{\text{min}}},
\end{equation}
```
where $c$ is a constant of order 1, $\chi^{2}_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum value of $\chi^{2}$ at given $\Theta$. Note that $\chi^{2}_{\text{min}}$ can be obtained in a simulated annealing process to very low $\Theta$.

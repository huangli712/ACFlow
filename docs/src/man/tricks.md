# [Tricks and tips](@id tricks)

*A comprehensive guide about how to perform reliable analytic continuation.*

As is well-known, analytic continuation is a tedious, tricky, and complicated job. This page contains all of the details (and experiences), that need to be known by the users, about how to get reliable and accurate spectra by using various solvers as implemented in the ACFlow toolkit.

    The following tricks and tips are **MY** personal viewpoints or experiences. They are not general rules. They might be wrong or ineffective or useless for some cases. They are definitely not suitable for the other analytic continuation codes.

## [General rules](@id general)

1. It would be better to perform analytic continuation in Matsubara frequency axis, instead of imaginary time axis. See [`grid`](@ref grid) and [`ngrid`](@ref ngrid).

2. Employ the MaxEnt solver for a fast analytic continuation task. And then the stochastic methods can be used to get a better spectrum. See [`solver`](@ref solver).

3. If the input data is broken or discontinuous, please setup the [`grid`](@ref grid) parameter correctly.

4. Set [`nmesh`](@ref nmesh) to an odd number.

5. The spectra generated by any analytic continuation solvers (`Aout.data`) can be used as the default model for the `MaxEnt` and `StochAC` solvers. See [`mtype`](@ref mtype).

6. Employ the [`pmode`](@ref pmodel) and [`mtype`](@ref mtype) parameters to customize the default model if you know *a priori* information about the spectra.

7. Employ the [`pmesh`](@ref pmesh) and [`mesh`](@ref mesh) parameters to customize the real-frequency mesh if you know the positions for the sharp features in the spectra.

8. Employ the [`exclude`](@ref exclude) parameters to limit the distributions of random fields for the `StochAC`, `StochSK`, and `StochPX` solvers, if you have rough estimations about the band edges or band gaps in the spectra. Actually, we can use the constrained algorithm to determine the positions for these sharp features.

## [MaxEnt solver](@id maxent)

1. The `chi2kink` and `bryan` algorithms are recommended. See [`method`](@ref maxent_method).

2. The Shannon-Jaynes entropy is recommented. But sometimes, if sharp features are essential, please choose the Bayesian Reconstruction entropy. See [`stype`](@ref maxent_stype).

3. Adjust the [`nalph`](@ref maxent_nalph), [`alpha`](@ref maxent_alpha), [`ratio`](@ref maxent_ratio) parameters to make sure that the ``\chi^2(\alpha)`` curve is reasonable. It means that the `default model region` and the `noise-fitting region` should exhibit similar lengths.

4. If there is a `NaN` error, please decrease the [`nalph`](@ref maxent_nalph) parameter at first. And then you can increase the [`alpha`](@ref maxent_alpha) parameter. Of cource, a different scheme for determining optimal ``\alpha`` is also possible. See [`method`](@ref maxent_method).

## [MaxEnt solver](@id barrat)

1. If you know the possible type of the spectrum (continuum or discrete), please setup the `atype` parameter. See [`atype`](@ref atype_barrat). 

## [NevanAC solver](@id nevanac)

1. It is extremely sensitive to the noise. So please make sure that the input data is smooth and is free of noise.

2. to be done

## [StochAC solver](@id stochac)

1. Increase `nfine` to 20000.

2. to be done.

## [StochSK solver](@id stochsk)

1. The `chi2min` algorithm is recommended. See [`method`](@ref stochsk_method).

2. to be done.

## [StochOM solver](@id stochom)

1. It is more efficient for Matsubara frequency Green's functions.

2. to be done.

## [StochPX solver](@id stochpx)

1. If the spectrum is expected to be broad, please set `method = 'mean'`. If the spectrum is expected to be ``\delta``-like, please set `method = 'best'`. See [`method`](@ref stochpx_method).

2. Run it parallelly (use `Pacrun.jl`).

3. Increase `ntry` to get smooth spectrum. See [`ntry`](@ref stochpx_ntry)

4. The `nstep` parameter is related with the `npole` parameter. If `npole` is large, `nstep` could be small. If `npole` is small, `nstep` should be large. See [`nstep`](@ref stochpx_nstep) and [`npole`](@ref stochpx_npole).

5. For condensed matter cases, `npole` should be quite large. While for molecule cases, `npole` should be small. See [`npole`](@ref stochpx_npole).

6. How to determine the `nstep` parameter? We just increase `nstep` from its default value and observe the terminal output of the `StochPX` solver. If ``\chi^2`` becomes stable (it means that the value of ``\chi^2`` can be oscillating, but increasing `nstep` can not suppress ``\chi^2`` further), the corresponding `nstep` is optimal. See [`nstep`](@ref stochpx_nstep).

7. How to determine the `theta` parameter? Please look at the acceptance probabilities for various Monte Carlo proposals in the `stat.data` file. They should not be too large or too small, or else we should adjust `theta`. See [`theta`](@ref stochpx_theta).

8. If you want to obtain a smoother spectrum, please increase `eta`, or else reduce `eta`. See [`eta`](@ref stochpx_eta).

9. If the spectrum contains many sharp features, the `constrained sampling algorithm` and `self-adaptive sampling algorithm` can help. See [`constrained sampling algorithm`](@ref stochpx_csa) and [`self-adaptive sampling algorithm`](@ref stochpx_ssa) for the basic principles.

# Output Files

Once the analytic continuation simulation is finished, the final spectral function ``A(\omega)`` is outputted to `Aout.data`. Note that ``A(\omega)`` is equivalent to the imaginary part of real frequency Green's function Im``G(\omega)``. Then the ACFlow toolkit will automatically calculate the corresponding real part Re``G(\omega)`` via the [Kramers-Kronig transformation](@ref spectrum). The full Green's function at real axis ``G(\omega)`` is stored in `Gout.data`. The spectral function is also used to reconstruct the imaginary time or Matsubara Green's functions [``\tilde{G}(\tau)`` or ``\tilde{G}(i\omega_n)``], which is stored in `repr.data`. Besides the three output files, the ACFlow toolkit will generate quite a few output files, which can be used to analyze and diagnose the calculated results. All of the possible output files of the ACFlow toolkit are collected and explained in **Table 1**.

!!! warning

    For bosonic systems, the `MaxEnt`, `StochAC`, `StochSK`, and `StochOM` solvers will generate and output ``\tilde{A}(\omega)``, instead of traditional ``A(\omega)``. That is to say, in `Aout.data`, the data are actually ``\tilde{A}(\omega)``. If the users want to retrieve ``A(\omega)``, they have to do the transformation by themselves:

    ```math
    \tilde{A}(\omega) = \frac{A(\omega)}{\omega},
    ```

    or resort to `Gout.data`. On the other hand, the `BarRat` and `StochPX` solvers will always generate and output ``A(\omega)``, irrespective of bosonic and fermionic systems.

    The `NevanAC` solver doesn't support bosonic system directly.

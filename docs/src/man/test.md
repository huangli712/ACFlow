## ACTest

[ACTest](https://github.com/huangli712/ACTest) is a benchmark tool for ACFlow. It can generate randomly a lot of spectral functions and the corresponding Green's functions. These synthetic data can be used to benchmark the analytic continuation solvers as implemented in ACFlow.

More technical details could be found in [arXiv:2411.16412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16412). The relevant paper has been published at *Comput. Phys. Commun.* **316**, 109785 (2025).

## ACTD

[ACTD](https://github.com/huangli712/ACTD) is a big dataset which contains many Green's functions and the relevent spectral functions. It can be used to benchmark the analytic continuation methods, and train the machine learning models. Note that ACTD is generated by ACTest.

The technical paper for ACTD is in preparation.

# Graphic User Interface

[ACGui](https://github.com/huangli712/ACGui) is a web-based graphic user interface for ACFlow. Now it supports the `MaxEnt`, `BarRat`, `NevanAC`, `StochAC`, `StochSK`, `StochOM` and `StochPX` solvers (in other words, all solvers implemented in the ACFlow package are supported). The users can use ACGui to generate configuration parameters, perform analytic continuation calculations, and visualize calculated results.

[ZenGui](https://github.com/huangli712/ZenGui) provides another graphic user interface for ACFlow. It is based on the `Dear ImGui` C++ library and its Julia wrapper `CImGui.jl`. ZenGui is more effective than ACGui. However, now ZenGui can only generate valid configuration files for ACFlow.

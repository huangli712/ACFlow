# ACFlow

*A full-fledged analytic continuation toolkit in Julia*

!!! info

    Thank you for using ACFlow. This documentation will help you to be familiar with and explore the ACFlow toolkit. It is just compatible with ACFlow v2.1.2-devel.250321.

!!! note

    Analytic continuation is an art of optimization. Please check your simulated results carefully.

!!! warning

    The ACFlow toolkit is in heavy development. Please use it at your own risk. If you encounter any bugs or troubles, or require new features, please consult me directly: **huangli at caep.cn**

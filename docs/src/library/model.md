# Models

*For default model functions.*

The **ACFlow** package supports various model functions, such as flat, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and a few unusual models. They are useful for the `MaxEnt` and `StochAC` solvers. In order to build these model functions, we need some additional parameters, including ``\Gamma``, ``s``, ``s_1``, and ``s_2``. They should be setup by using the parameter [`pmodel`](@ref pmodel).

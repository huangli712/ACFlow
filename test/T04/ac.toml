# Test: T03
#
# 0. Run gendata.jl to generate input data at first.
# 1. Change [BASE] -> solver (MaxEnt or StochAC or StochSK or StochOM).
# 2. If [BASE] -> solver is StochAC, [BASE] -> mtype must be flat.
# 3. If [BASE] -> solver is StochAC or StochSK, [BASE] -> grid must be btime.
# 4. If [BASE] -> solver is StochOM, [BASE] -> grid must be bfreq.
# 5. [BASE] -> finput must be compatible with [BASE] -> grid and [BASE] -> ngrid.
# 6. Execute ../../util/acrun.jl ac.toml.

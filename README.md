# ACFlow
 
The ACFlow package implements several analytical continuation methods, including maximum entropy method, stochastic analytical continuation, and stochastic optimization method. It can be used to convert the single-particle or two-particle correlation functions from imaginary time or imaginary frequency axis to real axis.

This package is currently under developement. **IT DOESN'T WORK NOW!**

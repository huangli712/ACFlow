# ACFlow

The `ACFlow` toolkit implements several state-of-the-art analytical continuation methods, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytical continuation method, and the stochastic optimization method. It can be used to convert the single-particle or two-particle correlation functions, which are generated by finite-temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations, from imaginary time or imaginary frequency axis to real axis.

# ACFlow

The `ACFlow` toolkit implements several state-of-the-art analytic continuation methods, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytic continuation, the stochastic optimization method, the stochastic pole expansion, the Nevanlinna analytical continuation, and the barycentric rational function approximation method. It can be used to convert the single-particle or two-particle correlation functions, which are generated by finite-temperature quantum many-body simulations, from imaginary time or imaginary frequency axis to real axis.

This toolkit is currently under developement. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

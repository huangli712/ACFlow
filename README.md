# ACFlow

The `ACFlow` toolkit implements several state-of-the-art analytical continuation methods, including the maximum entropy method, the stochastic analytical continuation, the stochastic optimization method, and the stochastic pole expansion. It can be used to convert the single-particle or two-particle correlation functions, which are generated by finite-temperature quantum simulations, from imaginary time or imaginary frequency axis to real axis.

This toolkit is currently under developement. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
